# Nutrition Label Project

## Overview

This project is a simple web page that displays a nutrition label using HTML and CSS. The nutrition label provides information about the serving size, calories, daily values, and additional notes for a food product.

## Project Structure

- **HTML File (`index.html`):**
  - Defines the structure of the web page.
  - Contains information about the nutrition label, including serving size, calories, daily values, and a note about daily nutritional intake.

- **CSS File (`styles.css`):**
  - Styles the HTML elements to create an aesthetically pleasing and well-organized nutrition label.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the nutrition label.

## Dependencies
